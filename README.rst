Solum - Application lifecycle Management
========================================

An OpenStack related project designed to make cloud services easier to 
consume and integrate into your application development process.

Solum is natively designed for OpenStack clouds and leverages numerous 
OpenStack projects, including Heat, Keystone, Nova, Trove, and more. We value 
vendor neutrality, open design and collaboration, and leveraging existing 
solutions where possible. One example is our use of Docker for deployment of 
containers. Multiple language run-time environments will be supported with a 
modular "language pack" solution so you can easily run applications written 
in any language of your choice.
